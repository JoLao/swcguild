HELLO FRIENDS,

IN ORDER TO IMPLEMENT SPRING SECURITY WE MUST:

1: UNCOMMENT THE ENTIRE SPRING-SECURITY.XML
    -NATALIE/JOSEPHINE MUST CHANGE LINES 24-31 IN SPRING-SECURITY.XML 
    WHICH GRANT ACCESS TO DIFFERENT PARTS OF THE PAGE BASED ON AUTHORITY.

2: UNCOMMENT THE APPROPRIATE PIECES OF THE WEB.XML 
    (THE CORRECT PIECES ARE INDICATED IN THE FILE)

3: WE NEED TO CREATE A LOGIN CONTROLLER, AND TO ADJUST LOGIN-PANE.JSP
    INSTRUCTIONS AND A TEMPLATE CAN BE FOUND 
    ON PAGES 7 AND 8 OF THE SPRING MVC SECURITY TUTORIAL ON MOODLE.

4: CONDITIONAL VIEW RENDERING
    -AKA MAKE BUTTONS DISAPPEAR
    -GO INTO EACH VIEW COMPONENT AND HIDE SOME BUTTONS 
    (INSTRUCTIONS CAN BE FOUND ON PAGES 9 AND 10 
    OF THE SPRING MVC SECURITY TUTORIAL ON MOODLE.)

5: INSERT THIS BEAN AT THE TOP OF SPRING-SECURITY.XML
        
        <!-- Expression Handler bean definition START -->       
        
        <beans:bean id="webexpressionHandler"           
        class="org.springframework.security.web.access.expression.DefaultWebSecurityExpressionHandler"/>
        
        <!-- Expression Handler bean definition END -->
