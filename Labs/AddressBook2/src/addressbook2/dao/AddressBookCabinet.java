//In this lab you will add the following features to your address book: 
// 
//1. Your address book must be able to handle multiple address entries with the same last 
//name. 
//2. Searching by last name must return some sort of Collection or array of Address objects. 
//3. The user must be able to search addresses by City 
//4. The user must be able to search addresses by State 
//a. When searching by state, the results must be sorted into separate data 
//structures by City 
//5. The user must be able to search addresses by Zipcode 
//6. You must use an ArrayList rather than a HashMap to hold the Address objects. 
//7. You must create an Interface for the AddressBook API (i.e. your DAO) that contains all of 
//the methods specified here and in AddressBook Version 1. 
//8. You must create an AddressBookImpl class that implements the AddressBook interface Â­ 
//you must use Lambdas, Streams, and Aggregates in your implementation.
